# 🧮 Calculator Project 🧮

Welcome to the **Calculator Project**! This program provides a simple calculator functionality that supports **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** operations. The calculator allows users to perform multiple calculations in a single session.

## 🌟 Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Continuous Calculation**: After performing an operation, users can choose to continue calculating with the result or start a new calculation.

## 🎨 Logo

```plaintext
<Insert your logo here>
```

## ⚙️ How It Works
  The program uses a dictionary to store operations as key-value pairs, where the keys are the operation symbols and the values are the corresponding functions.

## ➕ Operations Supported
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)

## 📖 Example Usage
```bash
# To perform calculations, simply run the calculator function.
calculator()
```

## 💻 Code Snippet
```python
from art import logo

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

operations = {
    "+": add,
    "-": subtract,
    "*": multiply,
    "/": divide,
}

def calculator():
    print(logo)
    shouldAccumulate = True
    num1 = float(input("What is the first number?: "))

    while shouldAccumulate:
        for symbol in operations:
            print(symbol)
        operationSymbol = input("What operation would you like?: ")
        num2 = float(input("What is the second number?: "))
        answer = operations[operationSymbol](num1, num2)
        print(f"{num1} {operationSymbol} {num2} = {answer}")

        choice = input(f"Type 'y' to continue calculating with {answer}, or 'no' to start a new calculation: ")
        if choice == "y":
            num1 = answer
        elif choice == "no":
            shouldAccumulate = False
            print("\n" * 20)
            calculator()

calculator()
```
